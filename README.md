BACK UP YOUR IMAGE FILES BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM!!
This program will overwrite every .jpg and .jpeg files in it's current folder

Currently it can only remove the metadata if it's before the JFIF header,
and there might be other instances that it still can't remove the metadata and it might just currupt the file
